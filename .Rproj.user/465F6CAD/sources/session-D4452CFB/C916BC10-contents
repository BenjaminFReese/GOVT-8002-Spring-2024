#### Preparation

```{r setup, include=TRUE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(readxl) # Package to read Excel data
library(stargazer)

```

#### 1) Join the data sets.
- Join the cases and vaccination data by date and state.
    - Case data: [United_States_COVID-19_Cases_and_Deaths_by_State_over_Time.csv](# https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36)

    - Vaccination data: [COVID-19_Vaccinations_in_the_United_States_Jurisdiction.csv](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-Jurisdi/unsk-b7fc)

    - Other state variables: USstates.xlsx

- Add the USstates.xlsx data and limit your dataframe to the states listed in USstates.xlsx.  
- How do you know if your merge was successful?

**ANSWER: Looking at the dataframe is useful.  Look at individual states - do the variables that are supposed to be the same (e.g. population) the same over the time period?  Do the case numbers look reasonable?**


```{r echo = FALSE}
## Load data 
# https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36
cases <- read.csv("United_States_COVID-19_Cases_and_Deaths_by_State_over_Time.csv")

# Vax data 
  # "COVID-19 Vaccinations in the United States,Jurisdiction"
  # https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-Jurisdi/unsk-b7fc
vax <- read.csv("COVID-19_Vaccinations_in_the_United_States_Jurisdiction.csv")

df <- cases %>% 
  left_join(vax, by = c("submission_date" = "Date",
                        "state" = "Location"))

# Add state variables
stFacts <- read_excel("USstates.xlsx", sheet = "data") %>% 
  rename(trump2020Pct = trump2020_percent) 
# %>% mutate(trump2020Pct = trump2020Pct)

df <- df %>% 
  filter(state %in% stFacts$stateAbbr == 1) %>%
  left_join(stFacts, by = c("state" = "stateAbbr")) 

```


#### 2) Create and add the following four variables to your dataframe:  density (based on *sqMiles* and *pop2019*), deaths per capita (based on *new_death*), cases per capita (based on *new_case*) and vaccinated percent (based on *Series_Complete_12PlusPop_Pct*).

- For a specific day (based on *submission_date*), show the top five states ranked by deaths per capita and calculate the average vaccinated per capita and the mean, minimum and maximum deaths per capita.

```{r echo = FALSE}
df <- df %>% 
  mutate("deathsPC" = 100000*new_death/pop2019, 
         "casesPC"  = 100000*new_case/pop2019,
         "vaxedPct"  = Series_Complete_12PlusPop_Pct/100,
         "density"   = pop2019/(1000000*sqMiles))

```


```{r echo = FALSE}
# Pick a day
DATE <- "10/18/2021"

df_day <- df %>% 
  filter(submission_date == DATE) %>%
  arrange(desc(deathsPC))

# Look at data (check for negative deaths etc)
df_day %>% 
  dplyr::select(submission_date, state, new_case, new_death, deathsPC, casesPC) %>% 
  slice(1:5)

df_day %>% 
  summarize(meanVaxedPct = mean(vaxedPct),
            meanDeath = mean(deathsPC),
            minDeath = min(deathsPC),
            maxDeath = max(deathsPC))

```

#### 3) Estimate three regression models with deaths per capita on your selected day as the dependent variable.
- Your first model will have only Trump 2020 percent as an independent variable.
- Your second model will add vaccinated percent as an independent variable.
- Your third model will add density.
- Before you estimate the models, write down your expectations about what will happen in these models.

**ANSWER: See table below. The key idea here is omitted variable bias.  If we only have Trump percent, then vaccination rates are omitted.  For October 1st, 2021, the Trump variable becomes insignificant when vaccination rates are included.  One complication, for which I suspect there is no clear answer, is whether vaccination rates are a post-treatment variable.  What do you think?**

```{r echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
## Models
ols.1 <- lm(deathsPC ~ trump2020Pct, data = df_day)
summary(ols.1)

ols.2 <- lm(deathsPC ~ trump2020Pct + vaxedPct, data = df_day)
summary(ols.2)

ols.3 <- lm(deathsPC ~ trump2020Pct + vaxedPct + density, data = df_day)
summary(ols.3)

```

#### 4) Assess specific vaccines
- Create and add vaccinated percent by state for each of the Pfizer, Modern and Janssen (which is Johnson and Johnson) vaccines.
- Use _pop2019_ for population
- Use Series\_Complete\_Moderna\_18Plus, Series\_Complete\_Janssen\_18Plus and Series\_Complete\_Pfizer\_18Plus for the vaccination totals.

- Estimate a model in which deaths per capita is a function of all three vaccination rates.

- Explain what the results mean, especially in light of the results above for overall vaccination results.

- Explain how one would compare the efficacy of the individual vaccines (e.g., whether the Moderna vaccine works better than the Johnson and Johnson vaccine).

**ANSWER: The major issue here is multicollinearity.  For October 1, 2021, the overall vaccination rate was statistically significant (see models 1 - 3 in the table) yet each of the different vaccines was insignificant (see model 4).  The vaccines are multicollinear (which can be assessed with an auxilliary regression) so the loss of power is not terribly surprising.  An F-test whether _all_ the specific vaccine variables equal zero is reported for model 4 and, broadly consistent with the results in models 1 -3 we can say that we can reject the null that all individual vaccines have zero effect.  To assess whether Moderna is better than Johnson and Johnson we would do an F-test where our restricted equation adds those two vaccines.  If doing so causes a substantial reduction in fit we would reject the null that the effects of those two vaccines are equal. (And we would want to take such results with a grain of salt given endogeneity in which states have which vaccines.)**

```{r echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}
df <- df %>% 
  mutate("vaxedPctModerna"  = Series_Complete_Moderna_18Plus/(100*pop2019),
         "vaxedPctJans"  = Series_Complete_Janssen_18Plus/(100*pop2019),
         "vaxedPctPfizer"  = Series_Complete_Pfizer_18Plus/(100*pop2019))

df_day <- df %>% 
  filter(submission_date == DATE)

ols.4 <- lm(deathsPC ~ vaxedPctJans + vaxedPctModerna +
             vaxedPctPfizer, data = df_day)

summary(ols.4)

```


```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'asis', collapse = TRUE}
stargazer(ols.1, ols.2, ols.3, ols.4,
          type = "html", # FOR PDF - the "asis" above makes it work
          keep.stat = c("n","ser", "rsq", "f"),
          report = "vcst",
          column.labels = c("Model 1", "Model 2", "Model 3", "Model 4"),
          digits = 3,
          dep.var.caption = "", dep.var.labels.include = FALSE)
```
