Think of this site as a log of all of the topics we cover in class and in lab sessions. I will make updates throughout the semester as we cover more advanced material. I hope this proves to be a helpful and beneficial resource and offer an easier to access format than the files posted to Canvas. If you are interested, I am happy to add you to the GitHub and you can make some direct edits to add your code! Let me know if any of this code doesn’t run correctly or if you have any questions or issues! 1.2 Loading Data The easiest way to load data into R and ensure you have the correct file path is to create a folder on your computer for each assignment and place the datasets directly into that folder. Create a folder on your computer for each new analysis Download your Data and move the file to your newly created folder Then open RStudio Click the project button in the top right corner Click new project Click existing directory Click browse and find the folder that you created Click create project Once your new project opens, click the blank page with a green plus sign icon in the top left corner under the file option Click R script to open a new script You should also be able to see your data file in the bottom right window of RStudio, click the file and follow the options depending on the file type Once your data is imported into R, the code that R automatically ran will be in the console window on the bottom left, copy and paste it to your fresh R script For example, in Lab 1, my code looked like: read_excel(\"USstates.xlsx\") Run this copy and pasted line of code whenever you open the R Project and you will never have to worry about complicated file pathing commands I recommend using the assignment operator &lt;- to give your dataset a short and simple name like df, dta, or, if you are working with multiple datasets, name each something short and descriptive "],["lab-i-tidyverse.html", "2 Lab I: Tidyverse 2.1 Join the data sets. 2.2 Create and add the following four variables to your dataframe: density (based on sqMiles and pop2019), deaths per capita (based on new_death), cases per capita (based on new_case) and vaccinated percent (based on Series_Complete_12PlusPop_Pct). 2.3 Estimate three regression models with deaths per capita on your selected day as the dependent variable. 2.4 Assess specific vaccines", " 2 Lab I: Tidyverse 2.0.1 Preparation ## Packages library(tidyverse) library(dplyr) library(readxl) # Package to read Excel data library(stargazer) 2.1 Join the data sets. Join the cases and vaccination data by date and state. Case data: United_States_COVID-19_Cases_and_Deaths_by_State_over_Time.csv Vaccination data: COVID-19_Vaccinations_in_the_United_States_Jurisdiction.csv Other state variables: USstates.xlsx Add the USstates.xlsx data and limit your dataframe to the states listed in USstates.xlsx. How do you know if your merge was successful? ANSWER: Looking at the dataframe is useful. Look at individual states - do the variables that are supposed to be the same (e.g. population) the same over the time period? Do the case numbers look reasonable? ## Load data # https://data.cdc.gov/Case-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Cases-and-Deaths-by-State-o/9mfq-cb36 cases &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Data/United_States_COVID-19_Cases_and_Deaths_by_State_over_Time.csv&quot;) # Vax data # &quot;COVID-19 Vaccinations in the United States,Jurisdiction&quot; # https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-Jurisdi/unsk-b7fc vax &lt;- read.csv(&quot;Data/COVID-19_Vaccinations_in_the_United_States_Jurisdiction.csv&quot;) df &lt;- cases %&gt;% left_join(vax, by = c(&quot;submission_date&quot; = &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;state&quot; = &quot;Location&quot;)) # Add state variables stFacts &lt;- read_excel(&quot;Data/USstates.xlsx&quot;, sheet = &quot;data&quot;) %&gt;% rename(trump2020Pct = trump2020_percent) # %&gt;% mutate(trump2020Pct = trump2020Pct) df &lt;- df %&gt;% filter(state %in% stFacts$stateAbbr == 1) %&gt;% left_join(stFacts, by = c(&quot;state&quot; = &quot;stateAbbr&quot;)) 2.2 Create and add the following four variables to your dataframe: density (based on sqMiles and pop2019), deaths per capita (based on new_death), cases per capita (based on new_case) and vaccinated percent (based on Series_Complete_12PlusPop_Pct).

Your first model will have only Trump 2020 percent as an independent variable. Your second model will add vaccinated percent as an independent variable. Your third model will add density. Before you estimate the models, write down your expectations about what will happen in these models. ANSWER: See table below. The key idea here is omitted variable bias. If we only have Trump percent, then vaccination rates are omitted. For October 1st, 2021, the Trump variable becomes insignificant when vaccination rates are included. One complication, for which I suspect there is no clear answer, is whether vaccination rates are a post-treatment variable.

Use pop2019 for population Use Series_Complete_Moderna_18Plus, Series_Complete_Janssen_18Plus and Series_Complete_Pfizer_18Plus for the vaccination totals. Estimate a model in which deaths per capita is a function of all three vaccination rates. Explain what the results mean, especially in light of the results above for overall vaccination results. Explain how one would compare the efficacy of the individual vaccines (e.g., whether the Moderna vaccine works better than the Johnson and Johnson vaccine). ANSWER: The major issue here is multicollinearity. For October 1, 2021, the overall vaccination rate was statistically significant (see models 1 - 3 in the table) yet each of the different vaccines was insignificant (see model 4). The vaccines are multicollinear (which can be assessed with an auxilliary regression) so the loss of power is not terribly surprising. An F-test whether all the specific vaccine variables equal zero is reported for model 4 and, broadly consistent with the results in models 1 -3 we can say that we can reject the null that all individual vaccines have zero effect. To assess whether Moderna is better than Johnson and Johnson we would do an F-test where our restricted equation adds those two vaccines. If doing so causes a substantial reduction in fit we would reject the null that the effects of those two vaccines are equal. (And we would want to take such results with a grain of salt given endogeneity in which states have which vaccines.) df &lt;- df %&gt;% mutate(&quot;vaxedPctModerna&quot; = Series_Complete_Moderna_18Plus/(100*pop2019), &quot;vaxedPctJans&quot; = Series_Complete_Janssen_18Plus/(100*pop2019), &quot;vaxedPctPfizer&quot; = Series_Complete_Pfizer_18Plus/(100*pop2019)) df_day &lt;- df %&gt;% filter(submission_date == DATE) ols.4 &lt;- lm(deathsPC ~ vaxedPctJans + vaxedPctModerna + vaxedPctPfizer, data = df_day) summary(ols.4) ## ## Call: ## lm(formula = deathsPC ~ vaxedPctJans + vaxedPctModerna + vaxedPctPfizer, ## data = df_day) ## ## Residuals: ## Min 1Q Median 3Q Max ## -1.0240 -0.3373 -0.0304 0.1689 1.5567 ## ## Coefficients: ## Estimate Std.

In particular, does performing the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca affect the views of pilgrims? David Clingingsmith, Asim Ijaz Khwaja, and Michael Kremer (2009) analyze this question by using two-stage least squares to compare successful and unsuccessful applicants in a lottery used by Pakistan to allocate Hajj visas. We will conduct pared-down models. The paper creates indices and implements additional statistical procedures to produce a broader and clearer picture. It is not a bad idea to read this paper to see how we can extend the methods we learn in class to your own work. I posted the paper on Canvas for your convenience.

A more religious respondent may be more likely to go on a Hajj trip and be classified as religious by others. Going to church, like actually being religious, is also a factor that may be correlated with x and lurking in the error term. 4.2 Explain how the “success” variable may satisfy the conditions for a instrumental variable. The two conditions, inclusion and exclusion, are: \\[Cov(X,Z)\\ne0\\] &amp; \\[Cov(Z,\\epsilon)=0\\] The lottery is randomizes, which means it is not correlated with the error term, or anything else other than the treatment variable, in our model. Further, it meaningfully effects our key independent which is tested below. 4.3 Estimate a 2SLS model Religious as a function of Hajj2006. ## With library(ivreg) hajj_public %&gt;% ivreg(x_s14aq10~hajj2006 | success, data=.) %&gt;% broom::tidy() ## # A tibble: 2 × 5 ## term estimate std.error statistic p.value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 (Intercept) 0.757 0.0169 44.9 1.09e-281 ## 2 hajj2006 0.101 0.0231 4.40 1.18e- 5 4.4 Show the first stage from the 2SLS model above.

All respondents were given the following statement: “Last year, police raided an apartment in 6 October City. During the raid, they killed 9 members of the Muslim Brotherhood.” Respondents were assigned with equal probability to a control group that got no more information or one of three treatment groups that received additional information. Respondents in the first treatment group were provided a paragraph that justified the killings from the security forces perspective. Respondents in the second treatment group were provided a paragraph that criticized the killings from a human rights perspective. Respondents in the third treatment group were provided both the security forces and human rights perspectives. Two outcomes were measured: if respondents thought the police tactics were justified, and if the police should the police be held accountable for killing the nine men. So that both variables are coded in same direction, this variable is coded as 1 if the respondent gave a pro-police answer (saying the police did not need to be held accountable). Data description Variable Description just_binary_main 1 if the respondent said the police tactics were justified; 0 otherwise. not_acc_binary_main 1 if the respondent said the police should definitely or probably not be held accountable; 0 otherwise. We call this variable no-accountability treat_b1 1 if respondent was given the pro-police paragraph treat_b2 1 if respondent was given the human rights paragraph treat_b3 1 if respondent was given both the pro-police and human rights paragraphs sisi_vote 1 if the respondent voted for Sisi not_voteboycott 1 if the respondent did not vote for some other reason than boycotting the election opposition_vote_boycott 1 if the respondent either voted for the opposition candidate or boycotted the election education from 1 (no formal education) to 8 (graduate degree). Values from 6 to 8 went to college. income 1 = Less than 500 pounds per month, 2 = 500 to 1000 pounds per month, 3 = 1000 to 4000 pounds per month, 4 = 4000 to 10000 pounds per month, 5 = More than 10000 pounds per month male 1 for men, 0 otherwise age_cat age categories: 1 is less than 35, 2 is 35 to 50 and 3 is over 50. Published paper (paywalled) Draft version of the paper 6.1 Why is an experiment useful in this context? Simply asking respondents if they agree or disagree with the police does not answer if and how different messages work. If respondents were simply asked if they agree with the either the pro-police or human rights messages it may be difficult to separate out whether the message was persuasive or whether the respondent was predisposed to approve of the argument. 6.2 Is there evidence of balance in the treatment? Why is this relevant? Check for balance of each treatment with respect to age category, gender, education, income, voting for Sisi and not voting for non-boycott reasons. ## Loading saved dataset load(&quot;~/GOVT8002/Spring 2024/Lab V/Ch10_lab_EgyptProtests.RData&quot;) ## Removing NAs dta &lt;- dta[is.na(dta$just_binary_main)==0 &amp; is.na(dta$not_acc_binary_main)==0,] dep_vars &lt;- dta %&gt;% dplyr::select(age_cat, male, education, sisi_vote, not_voteboycott, income) b_test &lt;- lapply(dep_vars, function(bal) { lm(bal ~ dta$treat_b1 + dta$treat_b2 + dta$treat_b3)}) ## Extracting Slopes and P Values slopes &lt;- round(sapply(b_test, function(x) x$coefficients), 2) p &lt;- round(sapply(b_test, function(x) { summary(x)$coefficients[,4]}), 2) ## Showing Results balance_results = data.frame(b1= slopes[2,], b1.p = p[2,], b2= slopes[3,], b2.p = p[3,], b3= slopes[4,], b3.p = p[4,]) balance_results ## b1 b1.p b2 b2.p b3 b3.p ## age_cat 0.05 0.60 0.01 0.89 -0.01 0.89 ## male 0.01 0.77 0.00 0.90 0.05 0.18 ## education 0.45 0.01 0.27 0.12 0.04 0.82 ## sisi_vote 0.02 0.74 0.05 0.36 0.09 0.12 ## not_voteboycott -0.02 0.71 -0.02 0.76 -0.05 0.37 ## income 0.18 0.10 0.06 0.55 0.24 0.03 There is some evidence of imbalance. 6.3 Is there evidence of an overall unbalanced sample?
